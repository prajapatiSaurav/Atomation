# 🤖 Automated AI LinkedIn DM System

A smart, scalable LinkedIn outreach automation using **n8n**, **PhantomBuster**, and **OpenAI GPT-4o** to automatically:
- Scrape leads from Sales Navigator
- Generate personalized messages
- Send connection requests or DMs
- Log everything to Google Sheets

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **User Form Submission**
   - Input:
     - Sales Navigator Search URL
     - LinkedIn Session Cookie
   - Triggers scraping via PhantomBuster

2. **Lead Scraping**
   - PhantomBuster extracts profiles: names, roles, companies, etc.

3. **Lead Segmentation**
   - Connection types:
     - 1st connection → Personalized InMail
     - Open profile → Direct message
     - Not connected → Icebreaker for connection request

4. **AI Personalization**
   - OpenAI GPT-4o writes:
     - Short, custom icebreakers
     - Warm, personalized messages
     - Targeted product suggestions

5. **Message Dispatch**
   - Triggers PhantomBuster to send messages:
     - As InMail or connection request
     - Based on connection type

6. **Data Logging**
   - Saves:
     - Name, LinkedIn URL, photo, icebreaker/message
     - Connection type (New, Old, InMail)
     - Status
   - Destination: Google Sheets
